It's all about sharing yourself with the world.
This repository is code for my portfolio, i intend to add a timeline, link my blog and any other information i'd love to share with friends.

## Development

Getting started:

```bash
$ pip install pipenv
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
$ cd build/
$ python build.py
```

If you only want to make this website for yourself and make on changes to UI, simply change the data in the following files:
```
atb00ker.github.io/build/data/
atb00ker.github.io/assets/files/
atb00ker.github.io/assets/images/creator-image.jpg
atb00ker.github.io/keybase.txt
```

Now, run `build.py` once, that's it!

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or reach me on Twitter / Linkedin.
